## Tech Impact / Diversity 

### Tell us about your hacker demographics

 First time hackers, which was around 68.7% of our total attendance.

72% male, 25% female and 2% non-bianry and 1% prefered not to say.


## Impact of GitHub Grant
- How did you use the grant funds? <br>
These funds were used to buy emergency food. As we had more attendance than expected we had to order last minute meals.
- How did the funds positively affect the outcomes of your event participants? <br>
No one had to code hungry. Every single hacker was well fed and working on their projects. We were able to order pizza at midnight to keep everyone full.
We also ran out of water and thus we could buy more because of these funds.

## Top Projects
